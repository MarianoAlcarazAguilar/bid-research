    "## 3. Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. What is the business or public policy problem you are facing?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to understand how advances in artificial intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), could impact the labor market in Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it's important:* This knowledge is critical for decision-makers in government, industries, and educational organizations to adapt labor and education policies to technological evolution. Lack of clear understanding could result in unmitigated job loss, increasing labor inequalities, and ultimately a less competitive economy nationally and internationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Immediate Task:* This project aims to replicate and adapt an existing study to evaluate the potential impact of large language models on various industries and regions in Mexico, using reliable local data. Our goal is to provide an empirical basis on which more effective labor and education policies can be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Who or what is affected by this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Workers:* Particularly those in sectors susceptible to automation and jobs involving repetitive tasks or data processing. This group could face job displacement if they do not adapt to new technologies.\n",
    "- *Businesses:* Companies will need to restructure and change their business models to adapt. Those that do not will not remain competitive.\n",
    "- *Universities:* Educational institutions will need to adapt their curricula to prepare future workers with skills more in line with the labor market.\n",
    "- *Government:* The government requires data about this technological change to make effective decisions.\n",
    "- *National Economy:* On a larger scale, if Mexico does not adapt, it will lag behind the rest of the world, resulting in impoverishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. How many of these people/organizations/places/etc. are affected by the problem, and to what extent are they affected (an order of magnitude is sufficient)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Workers:* It is estimated that a significant percentage of workers in certain industries, such as manufacturing or data processing services, could be affected by automation. For example, some studies suggest that up to 30-40% of jobs in these categories could be at risk in the next 5 to 10 years.\n",
    "- *Businesses:* Organizations that do not adapt to the new technological reality could lose, on the order of magnitude, millions of dollars in annual revenue due to reduced competitiveness.\n",
    "- *Universities:* Universities that do not adjust their curricula face a potential decrease in the employability of their graduates.\n",
    "- *Government:* The lack of effective policy could result in significant social costs, which could be measured in billions of dollars in terms of unemployment subsidies, professional training, and other adjustment programs.\n",
    "- *National Economy:* Failure to adapt to emerging technologies could result in a significant loss in terms of GDP, in the order of percentage points, affecting the economy on a national scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4. Why is solving this problem a priority for your organization at this time?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Temporal Urgency:* With the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence technologies in various industries, time is essential to understand their implications before changes in the labor market become irreversible.\n",
    "- *National Competitiveness:* Staying up-to-date with global technology trends is crucial for Mexico's long-term competitiveness. Failure to adapt could have significant consequences for our global positioning.\n",
    "- *Socioeconomic Inequalities:* Technological adaptation can amplify existing inequalities if not managed properly.\n",
    "- *Education and Employability:* Failure to take action could result in a generation of professionals ill-prepared for future challenges.\n",
    "- *Innovation Opportunity:* This problem represents an opportunity to develop new strategies, policies, and technologies that could not only mitigate associated challenges but also open up new fields of employment and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5. How have you attempted to address this problem, and what has been the outcome of your efforts?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Preliminary Research:* We conducted a review of existing literature and studies internationally, allowing us to identify knowledge gaps and areas where our research could contribute significantly.\n",
    "- *Methodology Development:* We have outlined a research plan to address specific questions we have about the impact of AI on various industries and regions in Mexico.\n",
    "- *Outcomes of Efforts:* Although we are in the early stages of the project, we have already achieved:\n",
    "  - Identifying data sources and methodologies that will be useful for further analysis.\n",
    "  - Generating interest and commitment from key stakeholders, including support in the form of mentorship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6. What other groups or stakeholders within and outside your organization need to be involved in defining and implementing this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Within the Organization:*\n",
    "  - Department of Computer Science: The academic department is crucial to ensure that the project aligns with educational objectives and competencies of the institution.\n",
    "- *Outside the Organization:*\n",
    "  - Oliver and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB): Their mentorship and expert guidance are crucial for the project's relevance, as Oliver has already worked on a similar project.\n",
    "  - National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI): Since we use their databases, their collaboration could be crucial for accessing more detailed or updated information.\n",

    "## 4. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "A goal is a concrete, specific, measurable aim or outcome that the organization will accomplish by addressing the problem. Building a technical solution, such as a predictive model, dashboard, or map, is not itself the goal of a data science project even if one of these tools might help you achieve your goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 What are your social, policy, or business goals, and what constraints do you have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals should directly relate to the problem you’ve identified, and will typically improve/maximize/increase or decrease/mitigate/reduce a relevant outcome or metric (e.g. increase the percentage of high school students who graduate on time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals often need to balance efficiency (e.g. help the most number of people in need with limited resources), effectiveness (e.g. maximize the total improvement in outcomes from the help you provide to people), and equity (e.g. allocate resources across groups to achieve equity in outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common goal-related constraints are limited budget, people and/or time; legal restrictions or\n",
    "lack of political will; or lack of social license.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Number | Goal | Goal Type (Efficiency, Effectiveness and Equity) | Constraints around the Goal |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **1**| Find the most exposed occupations and skills, therefore industries. | Efficiency | Lack of clear job and skill descriptions, with no information on the weight and importance of each skill for an industry. |\n",
    "| **2**| Quantify the percentage of jobs within each identified industry that will be exposed to LLMs. | Effectiveness | Lack of specificity and granularity in the data of job descriptions. No knowledge on the weight and importance of a job inside an industry. |\n",
    "| **3**| Quantify the exposure of each region based on the industries in the region, for a nationwide view of the impact of LLMs. | Equity | Disparity in data quality and granularity for each region of the country. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trade-off**: The goal of identifying the top skills might conflict with the goal of quantifying the percentage of jobs within each industry exposed to LLMs. Given our time constraints (4 months) we might focus on quickly identifying the top industries but might not delve deep enough into each industry to accurately quantify job exposure.\n",
    "   - If a trade-off must be made, placing more emphasis on the second goal might be beneficial. This is because while identifying the top industries is important, understanding the depth of exposure within these industries provides more valuable insights. However, it’s much more realistic to focus on the first goal given the time and resources we have at our disposal.\n",
    "   - Otro elemento de nivel 2\n",
    "2. **Trade-off**:Quickly identifying the top industries might lead to overlooking certain regions that are not as prominent in those industries but are still significantly exposed to LLMs. This could lead to an inequitable representation of regions.However, a robust analysis (product of the focus on finding top jobs irrespective of their region and industry) is a great job and wouldn’t be frowned upon and be a much more solid base for future projects than a project that’s too focused on doing region/industry specific research. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, given the time and data constraints, we should be focusing first on the first goal to produce a list of the jobs that are most exposed to LLMs and to try to quantify how exposed they are. Even if we don’t have the time or resources available to extend the report to regional or industry-level results, a solid, robust approach to the first goal will help future work to be developed on top of ours and provides a better tool for policy maker who might already be familiar with an industry or a region’s composition.  \n",

    "| **Will acting on someone who does not need this intervention have adverse consequences?** |  Not really, unless we decide to omit certain regions or industries without a clear, informed reason. | No |  If we include people in the meetings that shouldn’t be there, we will only waste their time and ours. | No |\n",
    "| **Can you provide any other useful information about this action?** | Data collection is the foundational step for the research. It needs to be comprehensive and try to remain unbiased. |  Proper data analysis is crucial for the accuracy and credibility of the research, since it will lay the foundations for further analysis. | No | Given our exploratory data analysis, we will have to dive deep into the existing models to tackle similar problems |\n",
    "| **Has it been tested to be effective?** | Yes, BID has already done some work collecting and consolidating the data in an effective, problem-domain informed way; also INEGI data has been previously shown to be easily aggregated to other data sources. | Yes, data analysis is a standard research procedure. | Yes, meetings to catch up are always positive if they are short, concise and periodical but not daily. | Yes |\n",
